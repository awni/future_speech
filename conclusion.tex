\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Table~\ref{tab:predictions} summarizes my predictions for the progress in
speech recognition to the year 2030. The predictions show that the coming
decade could be just as exciting and important to the development of speech
recognition and spoken language understanding as the previous one. We still
have many research problems to solve before speech recognition will reach the
point where it works all the time, for everyone. However, this is a goal worth
working toward, as speech recognition is a key component to more fluid,
natural, and accessible interactions with technology.
