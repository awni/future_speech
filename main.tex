\begin{abstract}
    The decade from 2010 to 2020 saw remarkable improvements in automatic
    speech recognition. Many people now use use speech recognition on a daily
    basis, for example to perform voice search queries, send text messages, and
    interact with voice assistants like Amazon Alex and Siri by Apple. Before
    2010 most people rarely used speech recognition. Given the remarkable
    changes in the state of speech technology over the previous decade, what
    can we say about the developments over the coming decade? I attempt
    forecast the state of speech recognition research and applications by the
    year 2030. While the changes to general speech recognition accuracy will
    not be as dramatic as in the previous decade, we have an exciting decade of
    progress in speech technology ahead of us.
