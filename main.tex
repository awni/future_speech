\begin{abstract}
    The decade from 2010 to 2020 saw remarkable improvements in automatic
    speech recognition. Many people now use speech recognition on a daily
    basis, for example to perform voice search queries, send text messages, and
    interact with voice assistants like Amazon Alexa and Siri by Apple. Before
    2010 most people rarely used speech recognition. Given the remarkable
    changes in the state of speech recognition over the previous decade, what
    can we expect over the coming decade? I attempt to forecast the state of
    speech recognition research and applications by the year 2030. While the
    changes to general speech recognition accuracy will not be as dramatic as
    in the previous decade, I suggest we have an exciting decade of progress in
    speech technology ahead of us.
