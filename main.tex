\begin{abstract}
    Over the previous decade (2010-2020) remarkable improvements were made in
    automatic speech recognition. Many people now use speech
    recognition on a daily basis. Before 2010 most people rarely used speech
    recognition. We use speech recognition to perform voice queries, send text
    messages, and interact with voice assistants like Amazon Alex and Siri by
    Apple. Given the remarkable and nearly unpredictable changes in the state
    of speech technology over the previous decade, what can we say about the
    developments over the next decade? I attempt forecast the state of speech
    recognition research and applications by the year 2030. While perhaps not
    as dramatic as the previous decade, I believe we still have an exciting
    decade of progress in speech technology ahead of us.
