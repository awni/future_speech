\subsection{Transcription Services}

{\bf Prediction} By the end of the decade, 99\% of transcribed speech will be
done by automatic speech recognition. Human transcribers will perform quality
control and correct or transcribe the more difficult utterances. Transcription
services include for example captioning video, transcribing interviews, and
transcribing lectures or speeches.

\subsection{Voice Assistants}

{\bf Prediction:} Voice assistants will get better, but incrementally not
fundamentally. Speech recognitions is no longer the bottleneck to better voice
assistants. The bottlenecks are now fully in the language understanding domain
including the ability to maintain conversations, multi-ply contextual
responses, and much wider domain question and answering. We will continue to
make incremental progress on these so-called AI-complete
problems\footnote{\citet[sec. 4]{shapiro1992encyclopedia} defines an AI task as
AI-complete if solving it is equivalent to ``solving the general AI problem'',
which he defines as ``producing a generally intelligent computer program''.}
but I don't expect them to be considered ``solved'' by 2030.

Will we live in smart homes that are always listening and can respond to our
every vocal beck and call. No. Will we wear augmented reality glasses on our
faces and control them with our voice. I don't think so.
